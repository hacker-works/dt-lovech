# Gatsby Setup

Let's start in the main directory `cd dt-lovech`:
```bash
npm init gatsby

npx: installed 1 in 1.25s
create-gatsby version 0.2.1



                           Welcome to Gatsby!



This command will generate a new Gatsby site for you in 
/Users/vladi/Work/dt-lovech with the setup you select. Let's answer some
